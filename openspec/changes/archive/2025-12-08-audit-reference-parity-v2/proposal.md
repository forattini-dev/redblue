# Change: Tool Parity Audit

## Why

To verify `redblue` as a "single-binary replacement" for common security tools, we must audit the reference tools included in the repository against our current implementation.

## What Changes

This is an **Audit & Analysis** proposal. We will systematically verify if `redblue` implements the core capabilities of each reference tool.

**Outcome:**
- A list of completed verifications.
- A list of **Gaps** (missing features) to be addressed in future proposals.

## Impact

No code changes in this phase. Documentation and backlog updates only.
